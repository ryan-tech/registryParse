Hello current registry creator

This is how I've been doing the registries.

1. Download the excel spreadsheet from the naqtc.cse.unr.edu website

2. Move the roster.xlsx to this directory

3. Convert the xlsx to csv using convert_xlsx_csv.py

There is a copy of the current registry (registry-sorted.csv) in the w2 server so go scp that

I usually scp to banyan, then scp from banyan to my local machine into this directory

Now that you have the roster and the registry, its time to merge.
